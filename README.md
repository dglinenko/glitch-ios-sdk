Glitch iOS SDK
===============
Note: This is a fork of https://github.com/tinyspeck/glitch-ios-sdk with ARC and modern ObjC support.

This SDK is intended to help you interact with the [Glitch API](http://api.glitch.com/). The SDK includes authorization through OAuth and functionality for calling the API.

If you have any feedback or find bugs, please let us know on the [Glitch Developer Forum](http://api.glitch.com/forum/)! We want to hear from you!



Sample App
---------------

* Open the included sample app in Xcode 4.4 or above to see OAuth and the API in action
